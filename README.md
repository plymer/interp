This project will be a testing ground for coming up with a fast + efficient way of interpolating lat/lon point data into a series of isolines and isoareas.

I will explore different geospatial analysis and interpolation methods in order to improve on the results from the turf interpolate+iso(lines|bands) testing that was done in July 2025.
